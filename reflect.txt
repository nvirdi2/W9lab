Reflection 
This workshop had me work with templates for the first time. What is a template? 
from my understanding, a template is a way of hold code and or data for a specific 
parameter, and instead of writing the same process for a different parameter, the 
same code will apply to it. The declaration of the template was easy, however, the 
process of understanding why it was used for those two specific parameters and the other
template for the other one, took some time. I also understood where we are placing the
template makes a difference and how we type it too. This was kind of easy to learn since
there were the in-class examples that I could look off of to understand how to create it
and have it function. The way I understood this concept faster than others that were taught 
in this class was by looking at what it meant. If we have an integer and a double data
type and instead of re-typing the same process of adding for the templates can be used, however,
this can also apply to larger codes.
